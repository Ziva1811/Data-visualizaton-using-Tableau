# Data-visualizaton-using-Tableau

This is my first data visualisation project using Tableau. 

The data used in the project comes from a Kaggle dataset, it tracks the on-time performance of US domestic flights operated by large air carriers in 2015

 Tableau is a powerful business intelligence and data visualization tool that has a very intuitive user interface.
